### AI Agent Responsibilities

When you (the AI agent) are working on this project:

1. **Start Each Session**:
   - Read llm_handover.md FIRST
   - Check the "Last Updated" date
   - Review "Recent Milestones" and "Known Issues"
   - Understand current project state

2. **During Development**:
   - Take notes of changes made
   - Track issues encountered and solutions
   - Keep a mental/temporary list of updates needed

3. **Before Completing Work**:
   - Update llm_handover.md with ALL changes
   - Add changelog entry with today's date
   - Update relevant sections (features, APIs, issues, etc.)
   - Verify all information is accurate

4. **When Handing Off**:
   - Ensure llm_handover.md is complete and current
   - Highlight any unfinished work in "Next Steps"
   - Document any blocking issues in "Known Issues"
   - Update git status accurately

### Automation Reminder

Set a mental trigger to update llm_handover.md:

- ✅ After every successful feature completion
- ✅ After fixing any bug
- ✅ After every testing cycle
- ✅ Before ending a development session
- ✅ When discovering new issues
- ✅ When making infrastructure changes

### Non-Negotiable Rule

**You MUST NOT mark a task as complete without updating llm_handover.md.**

This document is the project's memory. Without it, future AI agents (and humans) will waste time rediscovering context, repeating work, or introducing bugs due to lack of understanding.
