# The Recommender Agent - Complete Specification

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Stage**: 2 - Recommendations (Enterprise AI Infrastructure)
**Date**: November 3, 2025
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

**The Recommender** is an AI agent that analyzes legacy code documentation and produces intelligent modernization recommendations. It bridges the gap between understanding (Stage 1: the_documenter) and action (Stage 3: development_agent) by providing:

- **Technology alternatives** - Modern frameworks to replace legacy systems
- **Architecture patterns** - Cloud-native, microservices, event-driven designs
- **Migration strategies** - Rewrite, refactor, replatform, or retire decisions
- **Risk assessments** - Effort estimation, business impact, technical debt scoring
- **Implementation roadmaps** - Step-by-step modernization plans

### The Problem
- Legacy systems documented but unclear how to modernize
- Technology decisions made without comprehensive analysis
- Risk assessments based on gut feeling rather than data
- Migration strategies inconsistent across components
- No systematic way to evaluate alternatives

### The Solution
- **Intelligent analysis** - Parse documented artifacts to understand legacy patterns
- **Technology mapping** - Match legacy constructs to modern equivalents
- **Multi-criteria evaluation** - Score alternatives on cost, risk, effort, benefit
- **Context-aware recommendations** - Consider business constraints, team skills, timeline
- **Actionable roadmaps** - Concrete steps from current state to target state

### 3. Architecture Pattern Recommendation

**What It Does**: Suggests modern architecture patterns for legacy systems

**Pattern Catalog**:

#### Pattern 1: Monolith → Microservices
```yaml
pattern: "Strangler Fig Pattern"
description: "Gradually replace monolith components with microservices"

applicability:
  - condition: "Large monolith with clear bounded contexts"
  - condition: "Need for independent scaling"
  - condition: "Multiple teams working on codebase"

steps:
  1. "Identify bounded contexts from business logic documentation"
  2. "Extract one context at a time as microservice"
  3. "Route traffic through API gateway"
  4. "Gradually retire monolith components"

example_for_maccabi:
  bounded_contexts:
    - "Patient Management"
    - "Doctor Payments"
    - "Treatment Validation"
    - "Authorization & Roles"

  first_extraction: "Treatment Validation Service"
  reasoning: "Clear boundaries, minimal dependencies, high business value"

  architecture:
    - "API Gateway (Kong/Apigee)"
    - "Treatment Validation Microservice (Spring Boot)"
    - "Patient Data Microservice (Spring Boot)"
    - "Payments Microservice (Spring Boot)"
    - "Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)"
```

#### Pattern 2: Monolith → Modular Monolith
```yaml
pattern: "Modular Monolith"
description: "Restructure monolith into modules before splitting"

applicability:
  - condition: "Team not ready for microservices complexity"
  - condition: "Deployment simplicity preferred"
  - condition: "Data consistency critical"

benefits:
  - "Simpler deployment (single artifact)"
  - "No distributed transaction complexity"
  - "Easier debugging and testing"
  - "Can evolve to microservices later"

structure:
  modules:
    - "module-patient (domain logic + data access)"
    - "module-treatment (domain logic + data access)"
    - "module-payment (domain logic + data access)"
    - "module-shared (common utilities)"

  rules:
    - "Modules communicate via defined interfaces"
    - "No direct database access across modules"
    - "Each module can become microservice later"
```

#### Pattern 3: Event-Driven Architecture
```yaml
pattern: "Event-Driven Architecture"
description: "Decouple components using asynchronous events"

applicability:
  - condition: "Need for loose coupling"
  - condition: "Audit trail requirements"
  - condition: "Multiple systems need same data"

components:
  - "Event Bus (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS EventBridge)"
  - "Event Producers (services publishing events)"
  - "Event Consumers (services subscribing to events)"
  - "Event Store (audit and replay)"

example_for_maccabi:
  events:
    - "PatientRegistered"
    - "TreatmentSubmitted"
    - "TreatmentValidated"
    - "PaymentApproved"
    - "PaymentRejected"

  benefits:
    - "Treatment validation decoupled from payment"
    - "Audit trail automatic"
    - "Easy to add new consumers (reporting, analytics)"
```

### 4. Migration Strategy Selection

**What It Does**: Recommends best migration approach based on context

**Strategy Matrix**:

#### Strategy 1: Rewrite (Greenfield)
```yaml
strategy: "Complete Rewrite"
when_to_use:
  - "Legacy code unmaintainable"
  - "Technology too obsolete (no modern tooling)"
  - "Business logic well-understood"
  - "Budget and time available"

pros:
  - "Clean architecture, no legacy baggage"
  - "Modern best practices from day 1"
  - "Team motivation high"

cons:
  - "High risk (big bang)"
  - "Long time to production"
  - "May lose hidden business logic"

risk_mitigation:
  - "Run old and new systems in parallel"
  - "Extensive regression testing"
  - "Gradual cutover (screen by screen)"

example_maccabi:
  component: "V_DIAGNOSIS_SCREEN"
  reasoning: "Simple screen (6 shared nodes, 0 actions), low risk"
  approach: "Rewrite as React component in 2-3 days"
  parallel_run: "1 month with both screens active"
```

#### Strategy 2: Refactor (Brownfield)
```yaml
strategy: "Incremental Refactoring"
when_to_use:
  - "Code maintainable but needs improvement"
  - "Continuous delivery required"
  - "Low tolerance for big bang risk"

pros:
  - "Low risk (small incremental changes)"
  - "Continuous delivery of value"
  - "Learn as you go"

cons:
  - "Takes longer overall"
  - "May never reach ideal architecture"
  - "Accumulated technical debt slows progress"

approach:
  - "Boy Scout Rule: Leave code better than you found it"
  - "Strangle legacy code gradually"
  - "Automated tests before each refactor"

example_maccabi:
  component: "V_DETAIL_SCREEN"
  reasoning: "Complex screen (52 nodes, 140+ handlers), high risk for rewrite"
  approach: "Extract business logic to services first, then replace UI"
  steps:
    1. "Extract treatment validation logic to Spring Boot service"
    2. "Replace WebDynpro UI with React, calling new service"
    3. "Gradually move handlers to new UI"
```

#### Strategy 3: Replatform (Lift & Shift Plus)
```yaml
strategy: "Replatform to Cloud"
when_to_use:
  - "Need cloud benefits (scaling, availability)"
  - "Code works but infrastructure outdated"
  - "Want quick wins before bigger modernization"

pros:
  - "Quick migration (weeks vs months)"
  - "Immediate cloud benefits"
  - "Can modernize incrementally after"

cons:
  - "Doesn't fix code quality issues"
  - "May not leverage cloud-native features fully"
  - "Still need to modernize later"

approach:
  - "Containerize (Docker)"
  - "Deploy to Kubernetes/Cloud Run/ECS"
  - "Use managed databases"
  - "Add cloud monitoring/logging"

example_maccabi:
  component: "ZZ_CL_DOCTORS_CONTROLLING class"
  reasoning: "Business logic solid, just needs modern runtime"
  approach:
    1. "Wrap ABAP logic in Java service (JCo connectors)"
    2. "Deploy to AWS Lambda/Azure Functions"
    3. "Replace incrementally with native Java/C#"
```

#### Strategy 4: Retire
```yaml
strategy: "Retire Component"
when_to_use:
  - "Feature no longer needed"
  - "Duplicate functionality exists"
  - "Cost to maintain > business value"

validation:
  - "Analyze usage metrics (last 3-6 months)"
  - "Interview business stakeholders"
  - "Check for hidden dependencies"

example_maccabi:
  candidate: "Screen X (if exists)"
  analysis:
    - "Last used: 18 months ago"
    - "Functionality covered by Screen Y"
    - "3 hours/month maintenance cost"
  recommendation: "Retire after 90-day notice"
```

### 5. Risk Assessment Framework

  testing_coverage: 30      # Medium (manual testing only)
  timeline_pressure: 20     # Low (no deadline pressure)

  total_score: 24  # (10×0.3 + 40×0.25 + 20×0.2 + 30×0.15 + 20×0.1)
  risk_level: "LOW"
  recommendation: "Safe to rewrite with 2-week sprint"

# Example: V_DETAIL_SCREEN
example_detail_screen:

  testing_coverage: 70      # High (no automation)
  timeline_pressure: 60     # High (6 month deadline)

  total_score: 71  # Weighted calculation
  risk_level: "HIGH"
  recommendation: "Incremental refactor, start with isolated components"
```

│  WebDynpro UI Layer (33 screens)    │
│  ABAP Business Logic (656 files)    │
│  SAP BW Database (integrated)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Issues**:
- Tight coupling (UI + Logic + Data in one system)
- Single point of failure
- Cannot scale components independently
- Deployment requires full system downtime
- Testing requires full SAP environment

### Recommended Architecture: Modular Monolith → Microservices

**Phase 1: Modular Monolith** (6 months)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Spring Boot Application              │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐    │
│  │ Patient  │ │Treatment │ │ Payment  │    │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↑
    React UI (33 screens)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear module boundaries (easier to test, understand)
- Single deployment (simpler operations)
- Shared database (no distributed transactions)
- Can evolve to microservices later

**Phase 2: Extract Microservices** (12 months)
```

         ↘        ↓         ↙
          Event Bus (Kafka)
```

**Benefits**:
- Independent scaling (scale payment service 5x during peak)
- Independent deployment (deploy treatment service without affecting others)
- Technology flexibility (use Python for ML in payment fraud detection)
- Fault isolation (payment service down doesn't affect patient lookup)
```

### Type 3: Migration Strategies

**Purpose**: Provide step-by-step migration approach

**Template**:
```markdown
## Migration Strategy: V_DETAIL_SCREEN

### Component Analysis
- **Complexity**: HIGH (52 nodes, 140+ event handlers, 30K LOC)
- **Business Criticality**: HIGH (500+ users, $50K/month revenue)
- **Risk Score**: 71/100 (HIGH RISK)

### Recommended Strategy: Incremental Refactor

**Reasoning**:
- Too complex for big-bang rewrite (high failure risk)
- Too critical to take offline for extended period
- Gradual migration reduces risk while delivering value

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Extract Business Logic (2 months, $80K)**
```
Current: WebDynpro → ABAP Class → Database
Target:  WebDynpro → REST API (Spring Boot) → PostgreSQL
```

Steps:
1. Create Spring Boot service with identical API to ABAP class
2. Extract `check_treatment` method to Spring Boot
3. Deploy service, keep WebDynpro calling it via HTTP
4. Run in parallel with ABAP for 2 weeks, compare results
5. Cut over to Spring Boot service
6. Repeat for remaining 22 methods

Deliverable: All business logic in Spring Boot, callable from WebDynpro

**Phase 2: Replace UI Incrementally (3 months, $120K)**
```
Current: WebDynpro → Spring Boot Service
Target:  React Components → Spring Boot Service
```

Steps:
1. Create React shell application
2. Replace one WebDynpro view at a time with React component
3. Use feature flags to toggle old/new UI
4. Run A/B tests to validate functionality
5. Gradual rollout (10% → 25% → 50% → 100% of users)

Deliverable: Full React UI, all features migrated

**Phase 3: Data Migration (1 month, $40K)**
```
Current: Spring Boot → SAP BW (via RFC)
Target:  Spring Boot → PostgreSQL
```

Steps:
1. Export SAP BW data to PostgreSQL
2. Run dual-write (write to both databases)
3. Validate data consistency for 2 weeks
4. Cut over to PostgreSQL
5. Keep SAP BW as read-only backup for 3 months

Deliverable: Fully migrated to PostgreSQL

### Total Effort
- **Duration**: 6 months
- **Cost**: $240K (development + testing + contingency)
- **Team**: 4 developers (2 backend, 2 frontend)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Parallel run, feature flags, phased rollout

### Success Criteria
- Zero downtime during migration
- 100% feature parity
- < 2 second page load (down from 8 seconds)
- 95% user acceptance
```

### Type 4: Risk Assessments

**Purpose**: Quantify and communicate migration risks

**Template**:
```markdown
## Risk Assessment: MACCABI ICM Modernization

### Overall Risk Score: 58/100 (MEDIUM)

### Risk Breakdown

#### 1. Technical Complexity (Score: 65/100 - MEDIUM-HIGH)
**Factors**:
- 789 files to analyze and migrate
- 33 screens with varying complexity
- 15+ database tables to migrate
- Complex business logic (treatment validation, payment rules)

**Mitigation**:
- Use the_documenter to understand all components first
- Start with simple screens (V_DIAGNOSIS) to prove approach
- Automated regression tests before each migration

#### 2. Business Criticality (Score: 75/100 - HIGH)
**Factors**:
- 500+ users depend on system daily
- $500K+/year revenue tied to system
- HIPAA compliance requirements (healthcare data)

**Mitigation**:
- Parallel run old and new systems for 3 months
- Phased rollout (pilot users → department → full)
- 24/7 support team during cutover
- Rollback plan tested and ready

#### 3. Team Readiness (Score: 50/100 - MEDIUM)
**Factors**:
- Team knows ABAP but not React/Spring Boot
- 2-3 months training needed
- Some developers resistant to change

**Mitigation**:
- 3-month comprehensive training program
- Hire 2 experienced React/Spring Boot developers as mentors
- Pair programming between new and experienced devs
- Celebrate early wins to build momentum

#### 4. Testing Coverage (Score: 60/100 - MEDIUM)
**Factors**:
- No automated tests currently
- Manual regression testing takes 3 weeks
- Test environments inconsistent with production

**Mitigation**:
- Build automated test suite (target: 80% coverage)
- Setup production-like test environment
- Automated performance/security testing in CI/CD

#### 5. Timeline Pressure (Score: 40/100 - LOW-MEDIUM)
**Factors**:
- 12-month deadline for full migration
- Some aggressive milestones

**Mitigation**:
- Add 20% contingency buffer
- Prioritize high-value components first
- Ready to descope low-value features if needed

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Effectiveness | Residual Risk |
|------|------------|--------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Data loss during migration | Low | Critical | High (dual-write, backups) | Low |
| Performance degradation | Medium | High | Medium (load testing) | Low-Medium |
| Missed business logic | Medium | High | High (extensive testing) | Low |
| Team burnout | Medium | Medium | Medium (training, mentors) | Medium |
| Budget overrun | Medium | Medium | High (agile, contingency) | Low-Medium |
| Timeline slip | Medium | Low | High (prioritization) | Low |

### Overall Assessment
**Migration is FEASIBLE with proper risk management**

Recommended approach:
- Invest heavily in testing and training upfront
- Start with low-risk components (V_DIAGNOSIS)
- Maintain parallel systems during transition
- Use agile approach to adapt as learnings emerge
```

**Scenario**: Modernize V_DETAIL screen

**Input**:
- Documentation: `WD/SCREENS/03_V_DETAIL_SCREEN/` (7 files)
- Context: Team profile, budget, timeline constraints

**Process**:
1. Analyze documentation (complexity: 52 nodes, 140 handlers)
2. Score risk (71/100 - HIGH)
3. Generate options (Rewrite vs Refactor vs Replatform)
4. Rank options (Refactor scores highest given risk)
5. Produce recommendation (Incremental refactor with phases)

**Output**:
- RECOMMENDATION_REPORT.md (35 pages)
- recommendation_structured.json (for Stage 3)
- MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md with 3 phases

**Time**: 15 minutes

### Use Case 2: Full System Modernization

**Scenario**: Modernize entire MACCABI ICM system (33 screens)

**Input**:
- Documentation: `WD/SCREENS/*/` (all 33 screens)
- ABAP class documentation
- Strategic goals (cloud migration, cost reduction)

**Process**:
1. Analyze all 33 components
2. Group by complexity and criticality
3. Recommend migration order (simple first, complex last)
4. Generate master roadmap (18-24 months)
5. Calculate total ROI

**Output**:
- MASTER_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md
- Per-screen recommendations (33 reports)
- Financial model with phased investment

**Time**: 2-3 hours

### Use Case 3: Technology Comparison

**Scenario**: "Should we use React or Angular for frontend?"

**Input**:
- Legacy tech: WebDynpro
- Team: 4 developers (know ABAP, no modern frontend)
- Constraints: 6-month timeline, $200K budget

**Process**:
1. Analyze WebDynpro patterns (component model, data binding, events)
2. Map to React and Angular equivalents
3. Score both on technical fit, learning curve, ecosystem, cost
4. Generate detailed comparison

**Output**:
- TECHNOLOGY_COMPARISON_REACT_VS_ANGULAR.md
- Recommendation: React (score: 92) vs Angular (score: 85)
- Justification: Better learning curve, larger ecosystem, matches WebDynpro component model

**Time**: 5 minutes

### Use Case 4: Risk Assessment Only

**Scenario**: "How risky is it to migrate V_DETAIL?"

**Input**:
- Documentation: `WD/SCREENS/03_V_DETAIL_SCREEN/`

**Process**:
1. Calculate technical complexity score (85/100 - HIGH)
2. Assess business criticality (80/100 - HIGH)
3. Evaluate team readiness (50/100 - MEDIUM)
4. Check testing coverage (70/100 - HIGH)
5. Consider timeline pressure (60/100 - MEDIUM)
6. Calculate weighted risk score (71/100 - HIGH)

**Output**:
- RISK_ASSESSMENT_V_DETAIL.md
- Risk matrix with mitigations
- Recommendation: "HIGH RISK - Use incremental refactor, not big-bang rewrite"

**Time**: 3 minutes
