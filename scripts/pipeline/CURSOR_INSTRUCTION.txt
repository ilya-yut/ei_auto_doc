Generate the 7 EI documentation sections and write each to a file. Do not add a document title or preamble.

1. Read each prompt file from this project in order:
   - scripts/pipeline/run/01_prompt.txt
   - scripts/pipeline/run/02_prompt.txt
   - scripts/pipeline/run/03_prompt.txt
   - scripts/pipeline/run/04_prompt.txt
   - scripts/pipeline/run/05_prompt.txt
   - scripts/pipeline/run/06_prompt.txt
   - scripts/pipeline/run/07_prompt.txt

2. For each prompt file, follow the instructions in it. Use the file paths given inside the prompt to read the input files from the workspace (input folder or paths specified in the prompt).

3. Write the output for each prompt to the corresponding response file (only the section content requested by the prompt, no extra title or preamble):
   - 01_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/01_response.md
   - 02_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/02_response.md
   - 03_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/03_response.md
   - 04_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/04_response.md
   - 05_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/05_response.md
   - 06_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/06_response.md
   - 07_prompt.txt → scripts/pipeline/run/07_response.md

4. Produce exactly 7 response files. When all 7 are written, tell me so I can run the assemble step.

5. Verification (before declaring done): For the Parameter Configuration Guidelines (04_response.md), run the verification prompt and then verify against the rules in the 04 prompt. **Verification prompt:** Run prompts/PROMPT_Verification_04_Parameter_Configuration_Guidelines.md on 04_response.md; overwrite scripts/pipeline/run/04_response.md with the full corrected subsection it returns. Then verify against the rules in the 04 prompt: (1) No "output only," "output field," "not a filter," or "used for output display only"—describe what each parameter represents; do not classify as filter vs non-filter. (1b) No generic or useless sentences: For each parameter block in 04_response.md, apply the useless-sentence self-check from the 04 prompt—"If I replaced this parameter name with another, would this sentence still be true?" If yes, the sentence is generic; remove or replace it with function-specific content (source of the value, where in the code it is used, or business meaning). Every sentence in each main explanation must add function- or parameter-specific information; remove any sentence that does not. (1c) No unnecessary technical references: No SAP table names, field names, domain names, or data types (e.g. CHAR(1), EKKO-BUKRS, domain EBSTYP) in the main explanation unless essential for business meaning or usage; remove or rephrase in business terms if present. (2) Every parameter from the Parameters file in exact order; only serial-number series (e.g. KEY1–KEY10, UVK01–UVK05, UVP01–UVP05, UVS01–UVS05) may be grouped; do not merge non-serial parameters. (3) Every boolean/flag (CHAR(1), XFELD-like) and fixed-option parameter has an Options subsection. (3a) DATE_REF_FLD, TIME_REF_FLD, and DURATION_UNIT (when in the Parameters file) each have an Options subsection with possible values (code-only or table-specific examples). (4) Currency parameters: business meaning only. (5) Date/time and lookback parameters (e.g. BACKDAYS, REPET_BACKDAYS, UDATE): business-oriented only; no internal variable or system names (R_DATUM, R_UDATE, SY_DATLO, SY_TIMLO, DATE_FROM, SY-DATUM). (6) Avoid /SKN/*, Z* unless necessary. (7) Every fixed-option parameter (e.g. DATE_REF_FLD, TIME_REF_FLD, DURATION_UNIT) has a **[PARAM_NAME] Options:** subsection with possible values. Fix any violation before finishing.

Section 4 only (04_response.md)

When generating or editing only Section 4 (Parameter Configuration Guidelines):

- Use scripts/pipeline/run/04_prompt.txt as the single source of rules. Follow every rule in it, including "No generic or useless sentences" and "Business-oriented language."
- For each parameter’s main explanation, run the self-check: "If I replaced this parameter name with another, would this sentence still be true?" If yes, delete or replace that sentence with function- or parameter-specific content (where the value comes from, when/where in the process it is used, or business meaning).
- Do not use SELECT, DELETE, WHERE, JOIN, or table/field names (e.g. EKKO, EKPO, EKKN) in the narrative unless the guideline cannot be clear without them. Prefer business wording: what the parameter is (company code, vendor, order date) and when/where in the process it is used (order header, schedule line, monitoring window).
- Avoid filler phrases such as "set to focus on," "set to narrow by," "when relevant to the data flow," "when needed," "when applicable." The pipeline verify step will fail if these appear too often.
- After writing 04_response.md, run prompts/PROMPT_Verification_04_Parameter_Configuration_Guidelines.md on 04_response.md and overwrite 04_response.md with the corrected output.
- After that, run the verification checklist in step 5 above (items 1–7) before considering the section done.
