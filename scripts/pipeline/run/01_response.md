## General Overview

This Exception Indicator (EI) monitors SD delivery document status and related header and item statuses in Sales and Distribution to identify deliveries that meet configurable date, organizational, status, and partner criteria. It provides visibility into delivery status patterns, goods movement status, billing status, and credit-check status, enabling detection of blocked deliveries, delayed processing, and status anomalies that require management attention.

This EI serves as an essential control for delivery and order fulfillment oversight by:
- Enabling detection of blocked or aged deliveries that require release or escalation
- Supporting identification of billing blocks and credit blocks that delay revenue recognition and collection
- Providing visibility into status duration for prioritization and root-cause analysis of delivery delays
- Enabling delivery performance and concentration analysis by organization, channel, and customer for resource allocation
- Supporting accountability and relationship visibility by sold-to, ship-to, and other partner roles for dispute and fulfillment oversight

This monitoring supports identification of deliveries stuck in specific statuses, billing blocks, credit blocks, and delayed goods movements. The EI is valuable for order-to-cash reviews, delivery performance analysis, and exception management in SD.

The EI uses delivery and status data from SAP SD (LIKP, LIPS, VBUK, VBUP, VBAK) and partner and customer data (VBPA, KNA1) and aggregates by time period and organizational dimensions.
