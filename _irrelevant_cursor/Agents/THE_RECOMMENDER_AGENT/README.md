# The Recommender Agent 🎯

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Purpose**: Intelligent modernization recommendations for legacy systems
**Status**: Production Ready ✅
**Stage**: 2 - Recommendations (Enterprise AI Infrastructure)

---

## 🎯 What is The Recommender?

**The Recommender** is an AI agent that analyzes legacy code documentation and produces intelligent, data-driven modernization recommendations. It bridges the gap between understanding your code (Stage 1: the_documenter) and modernizing it (Stage 3: development_agent).

### The Problem
- Legacy systems documented but **unclear how to modernize**
- Technology decisions made on **gut feeling** rather than data
- Migration strategies **inconsistent** across components
- Risk assessments **underestimate** real challenges
- No systematic way to **evaluate alternatives**

### The Solution
- **Intelligent analysis** - Understands legacy patterns from documentation
- **Technology mapping** - Matches legacy → modern equivalents (ABAP → Java/C#, WebDynpro → React/Angular)
- **Multi-criteria scoring** - Evaluates cost, risk, timeline, ROI, strategic fit
- **Context-aware** - Considers team skills, budget, compliance, business constraints
- **Actionable roadmaps** - Concrete steps from current state to target state

## 🔧 Configuration

### Basic Configuration

**File**: `recommendation_strategies.yaml`

```yaml
global:
  confidence_threshold: 0.70  # Min confidence to recommend
  max_alternatives: 3         # Max alternatives to present
  risk_tolerance: "medium"    # low, medium, high

sap_abap:
  alternatives:
    - name: "Java + Spring Boot"
      confidence: 0.95
    - name: "C# + .NET"
      confidence: 0.90
    - name: "Python + FastAPI"
      confidence: 0.75
```

### Advanced Configuration

**Customize for your organization**:
1. Add new technology alternatives
2. Adjust risk factor weights
3. Define custom cost models
4. Configure migration strategies
5. Set quality thresholds

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Recommendation too generic
**Solution**: Provide more specific context (team skills, constraints, goals)

### Issue: Risk score seems wrong
**Solution**: Override default assumptions, recalculate

### Issue: Want different technology
**Solution**: Request explicit comparison (React vs Vue, Java vs C#)

### Issue: Cost estimates don't match reality
**Solution**: Provide actual salary data, validate infrastructure costs
